# Noise-Studies
This is a collection of studies done throughout the years based on the use of noise as the only sound source.

## Rumore: 
   My very first composition in Max/Msp, coded after my first 3 months of experimentation with the software. The composition tries to start from a state of chaos shaping the noise into more pitched elements and then going back to pure noise in the end. Coded between September and October 2016
